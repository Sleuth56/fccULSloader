# Database Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the FCC database loader to significantly improve data loading and update speeds.

## Key Optimizations

### 1. Index Management

- **Disable During Load**: All indexes are completely disabled during bulk loading and rebuilt afterward.
- **Optimized Index Creation**: Indexes are created after all data is loaded rather than incrementally.
- **Consistent Approach**: The same index management strategy is applied to all tables.

### 2. In-Memory Processing

- **Memory-First Approach**: Uses memory-efficient processing to reduce disk I/O.
- **Batch Processing**: Uses batched inserts (50,000 records per batch) for better throughput.
- **Memory Mapping**: Uses memory mapping for file access where possible.

### 3. SQLite Optimizations

- **In-Memory Journaling**: Forces SQLite to keep all journal files in memory, completely avoiding disk-based journal files.
- **Pragma Optimizations**:
  - `synchronous = OFF`: Disables synchronous disk writes
  - `journal_mode = MEMORY`: Keeps journal in memory during loading
  - `cache_size = 1000000`: Increases cache to 1GB
  - `temp_store = MEMORY`: Stores temporary tables in memory
  - `locking_mode = EXCLUSIVE`: Exclusive database access during loading
  - `foreign_keys = OFF`: Disables foreign key constraints during loading

### 4. Simplified Data Loading

- **Single-Pass Loading**: Loads data in a single pass without temporary databases or complex transfers.
- **Direct SQL Access**: Uses direct SQL commands for better performance.
- **Efficient Duplicate Handling**: Efficiently handles duplicates during updates.

### 5. Performance Monitoring

- **Timing Metrics**: Records and logs loading time for each table and overall process.
- **Records/Second Tracking**: Calculates and displays loading speed in records per second.

### 6. Final Optimizations

- **Database Analysis**: Runs ANALYZE to update statistics for the query planner.
- **Compaction**: Performs VACUUM to reclaim unused space.

## Expected Performance Improvements

These optimizations should result in:

- **5-10x faster** loading for all tables by eliminating index overhead during insertion
- **Consistent performance** across all tables regardless of size
- **Reduced disk I/O** by keeping journal files in memory
- **Simplified codebase** with fewer potential points of failure

## Usage Notes

The optimizations are automatically applied to all tables during loading. No configuration changes are needed to benefit from these optimizations.
