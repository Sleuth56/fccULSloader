Description:
-----------
This module provides utility functions for file system operations used by the FCC database tools.
It handles directory creation, path management, file deletion, and other file system related tasks.

Functions:
---------
Directory Management:
- ensure_directory_exists(directory_path): Ensure a directory exists, create if not
- ensure_directory(directory_type, path=None): Ensure a specific type of directory exists

File Operations:
- file_exists(file_path): Check if a file exists
- delete_file(file_path): Delete a file with error handling
- delete_directory(directory_path): Delete a directory with error handling
- cleanup_temp_files(): Delete temporary files and directories

Usage:
-----
Import the functions and use them to manage directories and files:

    from modules.filesystemtools import ensure_directory, file_exists
    
    # Ensure data directory exists before performing operations
    ensure_directory('data')
    
    # Ensure a custom directory exists
    ensure_directory('custom', '/path/to/custom/directory')
    
    # Check if a file exists
    if file_exists('/path/to/file.txt'):
        print('File exists')

Dependencies:
------------
- os: For file system operations
- shutil: For directory operations
- logging: For logging
- modules.config: For configuration settings
