## Overview

FCC Tool is a command-line and web application that creates and maintains a complete local SQLite copy of the FCC Amateur Radio License database. This allows you to develop applications that can look up any callsign, entity, or license name without requiring internet connectivity. The tool provides functionality to download and update the database from the [FCC's Universal Licensing System (ULS)](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/universal-licensing-system), look up amateur radio call signs, search for licensees by name or state, and maintain the database for optimal performance.

The offline nature of this tool makes it particularly valuable for amateur radio operators in the field, emergency communications scenarios, or any situation where internet access may be limited or unavailable.

### Database Management
**[[Features](#features) > Database Management]**

FCC Tool can automatically download and update the FCC amateur radio license database from the [FCC's ULS database downloads page](https://www.fcc.gov/uls/transactions/daily-weekly). The tool checks for updates by comparing the last modified date of the remote file with your local copy, ensuring you only download new data when it's available.

Key features:

- **Automatic update detection**: Checks if a new version is available before downloading
- **Efficient data processing**: Downloads, extracts, and loads data into an SQLite database
- **Optimized data loading**: Uses temporary tables and bulk operations for fast data loading
- **Index creation**: Automatically creates optimized indexes for fast searching
- **Cleanup**: Removes temporary files after processing to save disk space

The tool also provides several options for maintaining and optimizing the database:

- **Compaction**: Reclaims unused space in the database file
- **Optimization**: Removes unused tables and columns to reduce database size
- **Index rebuilding**: Rebuilds database indexes to improve search performance

### Query Capabilities
**[[Features](#features) > Query Capabilities]**

#### Call Sign Lookup

The primary function of FCC Tool is to look up FCC license information by call sign. This retrieves all available information for a specific amateur radio call sign from the database.

#### Name Search

You can search for FCC license records by name using a case-insensitive wildcard search that matches names in any position. This is useful for finding all licenses associated with a particular person or organization.

#### State Filtering

The tool allows you to search for records by state using the two-letter state code. This is helpful for finding all licensees in a specific geographic area.

#### Combined Searches

You can combine name and state filters to perform more targeted searches, such as finding all licensees with a specific name in a particular state.

### Examples
**[[Usage](#usage) > Examples]**

#### Database Management

Update the database with the latest data from the FCC:
```
python fcc_tool.py --update
```

Force a new download regardless of whether the data is up to date:
```
python fcc_tool.py --force-download
```

Check if an update is available without downloading:
```
python fcc_tool.py --check-update
```

Update the database and only keep active license records:
```
python fcc_tool.py --update --active-only
```

Force a complete database rebuild with only active license records:
```
python fcc_tool.py --force-download --active-only
```

Filter an existing database to only keep active license records:
```
python fcc_tool.py --active-only
```

When using the `--active-only` option, the tool will:
1. Display the number of inactive records that will be deleted
2. Show a sample of call signs that will be removed
3. Ask for confirmation before proceeding with the deletion

This safety feature ensures you don't accidentally delete records you might need.

When using `--active-only` with `--force-download`, the database will be completely rebuilt with only active records, skipping the check for inactive records in the existing database.

Optimize the database to reduce its size:
```
python fcc_tool.py --optimize
```

Rebuild indexes to improve search performance:
```
python fcc_tool.py --rebuild-indexes
```

#### Queries

Look up a specific call sign:
```
python fcc_tool.py --callsign W1AW
```

Search for records by name:
```
python fcc_tool.py --name "Smith"
```

Search for records in a specific state:
```
python fcc_tool.py --state CA
```

Combine name and state search:
```
python fcc_tool.py --name "Smith" --state TX
```

Display detailed information for search results:
```
python fcc_tool.py --name "Smith" --verbose
```

## Configuration

The database path and other configuration settings are defined in the `modules/config.py` file. You can modify these settings to customize the tool's behavior:

- `DB_PATH`: Path to the SQLite database file
- `DATA_PATH`: Directory for storing data files
- `ZIP_FILE_URL`: URL for downloading the FCC database
- `TABLES_TO_PROCESS`: List of tables to process during data loading

[â†‘ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents-)

## Database Documentation

The FCC database contains multiple tables with information about amateur radio licenses. The primary tables used by FCC Tool are:

- `HD`: License header information (call sign, license status, etc.)
- `EN`: Entity information (name, address, etc.)
- `AM`: Amateur license information (operator class, etc.)
- `HS`: License history information
- `CO`: Comments associated with licenses
- `LA`: License attachments
- `SC`: Special conditions
- `SF`: Special free form conditions

> I created a detailed information about the FCC database structure, tables, fields, and their meanings, see the [FCC Database Documentation](FCC_DATABASE_DOC.md).

The FCC data is sourced from the [FCC's ULS database downloads page](https://www.fcc.gov/uls/transactions/daily-weekly), specifically the Amateur Radio Service database file (`l_amat.zip`).
