## Overview

FCC Tool is a command-line application that creates and maintains a complete local SQLite copy of the FCC Amateur Radio License database. This allows you to develop applications that can look up any callsign, entity, or license name without requiring internet connectivity. The tool provides functionality to download and update the database from the [FCC's Universal Licensing System (ULS)](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/universal-licensing-system), look up amateur radio call signs, search for licensees by name or state, and maintain the database for optimal performance.

The offline nature of this tool makes it particularly valuable for amateur radio operators in the field, emergency communications scenarios, or any situation where internet access may be limited or unavailable.

> **Database Documentation**: I created a detailed information about the FCC database structure, tables, fields, and their meanings, see the [FCC Database Documentation](FCC_DATABASE_DOC.md).

## Features

### Database Management
**[[Features](#features) > Database Management]**

FCC Tool can automatically download and update the FCC amateur radio license database from the [FCC's ULS database downloads page](https://www.fcc.gov/uls/transactions/daily-weekly). The tool checks for updates by comparing the last modified date of the remote file with your local copy, ensuring you only download new data when it's available.

Key features:

- **Automatic update detection**: Checks if a new version is available before downloading
- **Efficient data processing**: Downloads, extracts, and loads data into an SQLite database
- **Optimized data loading**: Uses temporary tables and bulk operations for fast data loading
- **Index creation**: Automatically creates optimized indexes for fast searching
- **Cleanup**: Removes temporary files after processing to save disk space

The tool also provides several options for maintaining and optimizing the database:

- **Compaction**: Reclaims unused space in the database file
- **Optimization**: Removes unused tables and columns to reduce database size
- **Index rebuilding**: Rebuilds database indexes to improve search performance

### Query Capabilities
**[[Features](#features) > Query Capabilities]**

#### Call Sign Lookup

The primary function of FCC Tool is to look up FCC license information by call sign. This retrieves all available information for a specific amateur radio call sign from the database.

#### Name Search

You can search for FCC license records by name using a case-insensitive wildcard search that matches names in any position. This is useful for finding all licenses associated with a particular person or organization.

#### State Filtering

The tool allows you to search for records by state using the two-letter state code. This is helpful for finding all licensees in a specific geographic area.

#### Combined Searches

You can combine name and state filters to perform more targeted searches, such as finding all licensees with a specific name in a particular state.

## Configuration

The database path and other configuration settings are defined in the `modules/config.py` file. You can modify these settings to customize the tool's behavior:

- `DB_PATH`: Path to the SQLite database file
- `DATA_PATH`: Directory for storing data files
- `ZIP_FILE_URL`: URL for downloading the FCC database
- `TABLES_TO_PROCESS`: List of tables to process during data loading

[â†‘ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents-)

## Database Documentation

The FCC database contains multiple tables with information about amateur radio licenses. The primary tables used by FCC Tool are:

- `HD`: License header information (call sign, license status, etc.)
- `EN`: Entity information (name, address, etc.)
- `AM`: Amateur license information (operator class, etc.)
- `HS`: License history information
- `CO`: Comments associated with licenses
- `LA`: License attachments
- `SC`: Special conditions
- `SF`: Special free form conditions

The FCC data is sourced from the [FCC's ULS database downloads page](https://www.fcc.gov/uls/transactions/daily-weekly), specifically the Amateur Radio Service database file (`l_amat.zip`).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Database not found**: Run `python fcc_tool.py --update` to download and create the database.
- **Slow searches**: Run `python fcc_tool.py --rebuild-indexes` to optimize search performance.
- **Large database size**: Run `python fcc_tool.py --optimize` to reduce the database size.
- **Download errors**: Check your internet connection and try again with `python fcc_tool.py --force-download`.

### Logs

The application logs are stored in the `logs/fcc_tool.log` file. If you encounter issues, check this file for detailed error messages and debugging information.
